# Crossbow Auto Release

Maintained version of [angeloanan/crossbow-auto-release](https://github.com/angeloanan/crossbow-auto-release).

Watch your crossbow (Quick Charge III required) turn full auto with this mod. 
Just right click and it fires. How does it work ? After 0.5 seconds (10 ticks), it will fire and start reloading again. 
"B-But ping will interfer !" It fetches every 0.5 seconds (10 ticks) your current ping, and adds it to the crossbow reloading time, ensuring it won't go crazy. 
In the Modmenu options, you can enable sound feedback, credits to angelonan for it.

You can find the .jar in build/libs.
